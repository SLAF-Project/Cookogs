## The Task

After having spent about 2 months learning ReactJS at The Hacking Project, we've been tasked with building a website that combines this library to our own back-end API.

We decided to build a collaborative cooking webiste whose main asset lies within the handling of the database.

## The Stack

We've selected NextJS combined with Prisma in order to build our API. Additionnaly, we've used other tools that fit our needs such as the Axios or Mantine.

## The driving concept

It's no secret that the internet is already well served in terms of cooking websites.

However, according to numerous testimonies, two main issues tend to be uncountered while navigating:

1. It's often annoying to have to scroll past the unnecessary introduction to get to the recipe itself.

2. Most classification systems make it hard to discover all varieties of a given dish.

To answer this, our system is heavily based on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), a music database and marketplace whose success is mainly based on its clever architecture, the main principle being that products are ordered through a two-level system: master releases and releases, the former having a 1:N relationship with the latter.

We've adapted this principle to the cooking world by setting up main dishes that can be adapted into as many recipes as the users will be able to provide. For example, while pizza is a dish, neapolitan pizze and calzoni are recipes.
